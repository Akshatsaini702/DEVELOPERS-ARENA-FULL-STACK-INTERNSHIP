Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. It showcases my projects and skills in a clean, responsive design. I implemented a light/dark theme toggle using JavaScript to enhance user experience.

Key HTML concepts used: semantic tags like <header>, <section>, <footer>, and forms for better structure.
Key CSS concepts applied: flexbox, grid, media queries, variables, and transitions to achieve responsiveness and modern styling.

Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements. This project reflects my journey in front-end development and building interactive websites.
